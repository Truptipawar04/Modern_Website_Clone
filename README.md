 Modern Website Clone

This project is a clone of an internationally awarded, modern website. Iâ€™ve achieved approximately 70% replication of both the design and functionality of the original website.

## Features

- **GSAP Animations**: The website is fully animated with smooth and high-performance animations using [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/).
- **Locomotive.js Scrolling**: Integrated [Locomotive.js](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) to create a visually engaging, smooth scrolling effect, enhancing user interaction.

## Key Learnings

- **JavaScript Positioning**: I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with X and Y positions in JavaScript to manage animations and layout positioning effectively.
- **Animation Techniques**: Learned advanced animation techniques using GSAP and how to implement smooth transitions.
- **Scrolling Interactions**: Gained experience with Locomotive.js for creating immersive scroll-based interactions.

This project has been a great learning experience, allowing me to apply advanced web development techniques to create an engaging, modern, and dynamic website.
